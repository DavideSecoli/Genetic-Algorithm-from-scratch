# Genetic-Algorithm-from-scratch
This is an implementation of an advanced genetic algorithm to solve the eight queen puzzle. The implementation uses elitism and is capable of solving N queen problems. Also, an hyper-parameters optimisation using Optuna is implemented which improves convergence time by over 300% to  ~1.4 seconds.
